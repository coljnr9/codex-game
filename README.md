# Codex Game

This project is a basic framework for a web-based world explorer game using WebGPU. The goal is to render a cute environment with realistic water simulation.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a WebGPU compatible browser (e.g. Chrome Canary with WebGPU enabled) to see the demo.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML page that loads the game.
- `src/main.js` – JavaScript entry point that sets up WebGPU and the water simulation.
- `src/style.css` – Basic styling for the page.

## Notes

This is an early prototype with minimal features to get WebGPU up and running.

## Deployment

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.


Once deployed, the game is available at [https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/codex-game/](https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/codex-game/).
